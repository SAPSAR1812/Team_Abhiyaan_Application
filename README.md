Current PORS:

I haven't applied for any PORs yet.

Why I want to join the team:
----------------------------
To experience the thrill of building and designing something that yields tangible results and practical applications in the near future. It would be sad if I completed four years of engineering without ever building a robot or drone. Also, I would get to interact and learn from peeps who love to innovate and design the future. Abhiyaan, specifically, delves into the world of autonomous systems and that is a field I am greatly interested in. Competitions would be the cherry on the top.
